# ARCHIVE

This directory contains historical documentation and development artifacts from the Macrokid project. These files are preserved for reference but are no longer part of the active documentation.

## Contents

### Session Notes
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of a development session (January 2025)
- **RECENT_UPDATES.md** - Historical update log (now replaced by CHANGELOG.md)

### Feature Documentation (Superseded)
- **MACROKID_GRAPHICS.md** - Original graphics documentation (now in `macrokid_graphics/docs/`)
- **MACROKID_THREADS.md** - Threading system docs (now in `macrokid_threads_derive/docs/`)
- **ENGINE_RUNTIME.md** - Engine runtime notes
- **EXPERIMENTS.md** - Experimental features log

### Design Documents (Archived)
- **OPTION_B_COMPLETE.md** - Framework features summary (historical design doc)
- **COMBINATOR_THEORY.md** - Combinator theory (merged into `docs/architecture/combinators.md`)
- **COMBINATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Implementation guide (merged)
- **COMBINATOR_COMPLETENESS.md** - Completeness analysis (merged)

### Meta Documentation (Superseded)
- **DOCS_INDEX.md** - Old documentation index (replaced by structured docs/)
- **TODOS.md** - Historical TODO list (now TODO.md at root)

## Why Archive?

These documents were part of the project's evolution but have been:
1. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer, better-organized documentation
2. **Consolidated** - Merged into current documentation
3. **Historical** - Session-specific notes no longer actively maintained

## Using Archived Docs

While these files are no longer actively maintained, they may contain:
- Historical context for design decisions
- Detailed notes from specific development sessions
- Original thinking behind certain features
- Implementation notes that haven't been fully migrated

**When to reference:**
- Understanding "why" behind old decisions
- Looking up historical implementation details
- Research into abandoned approaches

**When not to reference:**
- Current best practices (use `docs/` instead)
- Getting started (use `README.md` and `docs/guides/`)
- API reference (use `docs/reference/`)

## Documentation Structure (Current)

For active documentation, see:
- **Root:** [README.md](../README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [TODO.md](../TODO.md)
- **Cross-cutting:** [docs/](../docs/) (architecture, guides, reference, design)
- **Sub-projects:** `<crate>/README.md` and `<crate>/docs/`
